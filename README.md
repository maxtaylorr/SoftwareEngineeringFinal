# Description:
We are developing an iOS app that serves the purpose of displaying bars in the Columbia, MO area. It will display contact information, location, and their respective deals/cover fees. There will also be a GPS map that will give you directions from your current location and allow you change destinations between bars. The app will tell the user popular bars in the area and the deals, phone number, and other information about said bar.
